  - Reverse text

## Task Manager

### Before (Basic)
- Create task with title and description

- **Task Dependencies**: Tasks can depend on others, automatic blocking
- **Time Tracking**: 
  - Estimated hours vs actual hours
  - Efficiency calculation
  - Due dates and overdue tracking
- **Advanced Filtering**: By status, priority, category, tags, overdue
- **Comprehensive Statistics**:
  - Status and priority breakdowns
  - Category and tag analytics
  - Productivity metrics
  - Completion rates
  - Time-sensitive task tracking

## Time Utilities (New Feature)

### Completely New Feature
- **Italian Date Format**: DD/MM/YYYY as primary format
- **Multiple Format Support**: Italian, ISO, US, timestamp, full Italian with day names
- **Date Shortcuts**:
  - Simple: now, yesterday, tomorrow, last_month, next_month
  - Modifiers: EoD (End of Day), EoM (End of Month), SoD, SoM
  - Compound: "tomorrow EoD", "next month EoM"
- **Date Calculations**:
  - Difference between dates in any unit
  - Detailed breakdown (years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds)
  - Working days vs weekends calculation
  - Week of year and quarter information
- **Date Arithmetic**: Add/subtract time with any unit
- **Format Conversion**: Convert between all supported formats
- **Italian Localization**: Month and day names in Italian

## Architecture Improvements

### Before
- Monolithic server.py file
- All logic in one place
- No code reuse structure
- Difficult to maintain and extend

### After
- **Modular Architecture**:
  - `shared/`: Reusable base classes and types
  - `features/`: Separate module for each feature
  - Each feature has its own engine class
- **Type Safety**: Enums and type hints throughout
- **Error Handling**: Standardized ToolResponse with success/error/metadata
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or enhance existing ones
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Base Classes**: All features inherit from `BaseFeature`
2. **Standardized Response**: `ToolResponse` dataclass for consistent output
3. **Type Definitions**: Enums for all constants (Priority, TaskStatus, DateFormat, etc.)
4. **Validation**: Input validation in all methods
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling with detailed messages
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and type hints
7. **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging

## Performance Enhancements

- **Memory Management**: Limited history sizes to prevent memory leaks
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Optimized calculations and text processing
- **Lazy Loading**: Features loaded only when needed
- **Caching**: Results cached where appropriate
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple items at once

## API Improvements

- **Consistent Naming**: All tools follow naming conventions
- **Rich Responses**: Detailed metadata and statistics in responses
- **Flexible Parameters**: Optional parameters with sensible defaults
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Support for different output formats
- **Comprehensive System Info**: Detailed capability reporting
