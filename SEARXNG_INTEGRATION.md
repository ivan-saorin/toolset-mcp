# SearXNG Integration Summary

## What Was Added

SearXNG has been successfully integrated as a web search provider in the Search Manager. This adds a privacy-focused meta-search option that aggregates results from 70+ search engines without tracking users.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **New Provider Class: `SearXNGSearchProvider`**
Located in: `src/remote_mcp/features/search_manager/engine.py`

Key features:
- 10-second timeout (longer than other providers due to meta-search nature)
- Requires `SEARXNG_SERVER_URL` environment variable
- Returns results with metadata showing which search engines found each result
- Graceful error handling with detailed logging

### 2. **Configuration**
- Environment variable: `SEARXNG_SERVER_URL` (e.g., `https://searx.example.com`)
- No API key required (unlike other providers)
- Server must have JSON format enabled in its configuration

### 3. **Result Format**
SearXNG results include unique metadata:
```python
"metadata": {
    "engines": ["google", "bing", "duckduckgo"],  # Which engines found this result
    "publishedDate": "2024-01-01",                # If available
    "score": 0.95,                                # If provided by SearXNG
    "category": "general"                         # Search category
}
```

### 4. **Integration Points**
- Added to web providers initialization in `SearchManagerEngine._initialize_providers()`
- Included in all documentation (README files, deployment guides)
- Updated environment configuration examples
- Added to test scripts with specific SearXNG test case

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Search using all available providers (including SearXNG if configured)
await web_search("privacy tools open source")

# Use only SearXNG
await web_search("linux distributions", providers=["searxng"])

# Use SearXNG with other providers
await web_search("AI news", providers=["searxng", "tavily"])
```

### Testing
Two test scripts are available:
1. `test_search_manager.py` - Tests all search providers including SearXNG
2. `test_searxng.py` - Tests SearXNG specifically

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
export SEARXNG_SERVER_URL=https://your-searxng-instance.com
python test_searxng.py
```

### Caprover
Add to environment variables:
```
SEARXNG_SERVER_URL: $$cap_searxng_server_url
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
environment:
  SEARXNG_SERVER_URL: ${SEARXNG_SERVER_URL}
```

## Benefits

1. **Privacy**: No user tracking, no data collection
2. **Comprehensive**: Aggregates from 70+ search engines
3. **Self-Hostable**: Complete control over your search infrastructure
4. **No API Key**: Simpler setup compared to commercial providers
5. **Transparency**: Shows which engines provided each result

## Requirements

1. A running SearXNG instance (self-hosted or public)
2. JSON format must be enabled in SearXNG settings:
   ```yaml
   search:
     formats:
       - html
       - json
   ```
3. Network access from your MCP server to the SearXNG instance

## Public Instances

If you don't want to self-host, you can use public instances listed at:
- https://searx.space/
- https://github.com/searxng/searxng#public-instances

Note: Public instances may have rate limits or availability issues.
