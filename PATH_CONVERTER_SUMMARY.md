# Path Converter Implementation Summary (v1.1.0)

## What Was Done

I've successfully added a path converter feature to the Atlas Toolset MCP server that automatically converts between Windows and Linux path formats with configurable drive mapping.

## Update: Environment Variable Configuration

The path converter now supports configurable Windows drive mapping through the `MCP_WINDOWS_DRIVE` environment variable:

```bash
# Default (if not set)
MCP_WINDOWS_DRIVE=M  # Maps M:\ to /mcp

# Custom configurations
export MCP_WINDOWS_DRIVE=D  # Maps D:\ to /mcp
export MCP_WINDOWS_DRIVE=E  # Maps E:\ to /mcp
```

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Path Detection**
   - Detects Windows paths (with `M:\` or backslashes)
   - Detects Linux paths (with `/mcp` or forward slashes)
   - Automatically converts to the opposite format

2. **Path Mapping**
   - Windows: `M:\` â†’ Linux: `/mcp`
   - Preserves the rest of the path structure
   - Handles edge cases like mixed slashes, trailing slashes, etc.

3. **Three Main Tools**
   - `convert_path`: Convert a single path
   - `convert_multiple_paths`: Convert multiple paths at once
   - `validate_path`: Show both Windows and Linux formats with validation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/src/remote_mcp/features/path_converter/__init__.py`
2. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/src/remote_mcp/features/path_converter/engine.py` - Main implementation
3. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/test_path_converter.py` - Test script
4. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/docs/path_converter_guide.md` - Usage documentation

### Modified Files:
1. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/src/remote_mcp/features/__init__.py` - Added PathConverterEngine import
2. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/src/remote_mcp/server.py` - Integrated the path converter feature
3. `/mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/README.md` - Added documentation and examples

## Usage Example

When you copy a path from VS Code on Windows:
```
Input:  M:\projects\toolset-mcp\README.md
Output: /mcp/projects/toolset-mcp/README.md
```

This makes it easy to work across Windows and Linux environments without manually converting paths.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the path converter is working correctly:
```bash
cd /mcp/projects/toolset-mcp
python test_path_converter.py
```

## Integration

The path converter is now fully integrated into the Atlas Toolset MCP server and will be available when the server is running. It follows the same modular architecture pattern as the other features.
