## Style Guide

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use black for formatting: `black src/`
- Use isort for imports: `isort src/`
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Document all public functions with docstrings

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add calculator tool with advanced operations

- Implement power and modulo operations
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include unit tests for all operations

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use pytest for testing

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Update API.md for any tool changes
- Include examples in docstrings

## Project Structure

When adding new tools, follow this pattern:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def your_tool_name(
    param1: str,
    param2: int = 10
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of what the tool does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2 (default: 10)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing the result with keys:
        - success: Whether operation succeeded
        - data: The actual result data
        - message: Human-readable message
    
    Example:
        >>> await your_tool_name("test", 20)
        {"success": True, "data": {...}, "message": "Operation completed"}
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```
